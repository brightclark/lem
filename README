This is a preliminary release of Lem which is not yet feature complete.
It is currently released under a restrictive license, but we intend to
use an open source or free software license release for later, more
complete releases.

Lem depends on OCaml (http://caml.inria.fr/). Lem is tested against OCaml
3.12.1. Earlier versions might or might not work.

To build Lem run make in Lem’s top-level directory. This builds the executable
lem, and places a symbolic link to it in Lem’s root directory. Now set the
LEMLIB environment variable to path_to_lem/library, or alternately pass the
-lib path_to_lem/library flag to lem when you run it. This tells Lem where to
find its library of types for HOL/Isabelle/OCaml/Coq built-in functions.

The source language grammar and type system are defined in language/lem.ott,
available in a typeset form in language/lem.pdf.  There is also a very 
preliminary manual (not currently up to date) at 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/lem/.
